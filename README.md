# readup

A mobile prototype created for ReadUP App, which can help users get deeply engaged into reading experience.

ReadUp is a tangible interaction system that will provide users with data about their moods during the reading and encourage them to do more readings and more diverse readings.

Those data come from sensors in the wristband as well as users' self reports before and after reading. The system also provides users with several social and game features to motivate users to change their behavior.

Based on this concept, we develop our ideas into a medium fidelity prototype by using Axure. But recently, to make the interaction more intuitive and naturally, I developed it to a hi-fi prototype by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Using codes gives me more freedom and control over the layouts and interactions.
